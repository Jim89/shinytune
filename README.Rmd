# shinytune

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of shinytune is to make it easy to explore `tune` objects, similar to
`shinystan`.

To do this I need to:

* [ ] Figure out exactly what `tune` is producing
* [ ] Think about some sensible summaries/visualisations/explorations that could
be applied to that
* [ ] (Optionally) Compare to `shinystan` for reference (I don't want to anchor
too strongly to it, though)

## Exploring `tune`

Firstly, I need to figure out what  `tune` object actually contains.

Let's create one following the Getting Started guide on
the [tune
website](https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/articles/getting_started.html).

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(tune)
```
